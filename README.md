The purpose of the election audit analysis is to analysis election result data using python. We used various techniques using python to analyze the raw voting data to determine the following:

Total votes
Votes casted by each of the 3 counties
Largest County turnout 
Percentage of votes that each of the 3 candidates received 
Winner of the election 

We then exported our findings into a .txt file titled election_analysis.txt

This script can be used to determine which country has the largest voter turnout. In our analysis, we can see that Denver had the highest voter turnout. In the future candidates can use this data to determine which locations to focus their campaign. 

This script can be modified to get a more in-depth analysis of voter turnout. This can include average age of the voter, socioeconomic status, etc. This data can further help candidates determine which key demographics to focus on when campaigning
